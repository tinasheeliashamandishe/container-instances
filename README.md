<h1>Deploy an Azure Container Instances</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will Deploy an Azure Container Instances.<br /><br />
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables you to run containers without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. Containers are a lightweight way to package applications and their dependencies, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.
<br /><br />
With Azure Container Instances, you can quickly deploy containers onto a managed infrastructure, with features such as automatic scaling, fast startup times, and billing by the second. This service is particularly useful for scenarios such as batch processing, job scheduling, microservices architecture, and testing environments where you need to run containers without the overhead of managing virtual machines or a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.<br />
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
